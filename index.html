        To my one and only meewwww aka angry bird..hehe.I m really blessed to have you in my life.
         With each passing moment, my love for you grows deeper..  
         <br>Today, I want to make u a promise - a promise to stand by ur side through thick and thin, 
         to support u in your dreams nd aspirations, and to cherish every moment we share together. I wanna become ur strength 
           to be there when the storm rages on, and to hold your hand when the rain starts pouring down. I know sometime my actions upset u but my intentions are never meant to hurt you. The day you entered into my life , it totally changed my personality and my way of thinking. m really blessed u came into my life and thanks for sticking around when no one was there. 
           My dearest, I promise to always be there for u, no matter what.</p><br/>

        I promise to listen to u, 
        to understand you, I promise to laugh wid u in times of joy
         and hold u close in times of sorrow. I promise to respect u, to honor u, and to always be
          honest wid u.
        I promise u to be with u till the end and eternity
        
        Happy Promise Day, my love. Here's to a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless promises fulfilled.</p>
